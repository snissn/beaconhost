the idea is that this is a centralized service that facilitates off-chain oracle fetches for smart contracts.

idea of a customer would be someone doing a merch drop for NFT holders and wants to combine beaconhost with tokenhost to create a side chain for their merch drop, use the beacon chain programming in solidity to ensure that holders have an nft and issue merch tokens on the side chain!

we could have the code live entirely on the sidechain and have the redeem token function issue be issued by the end customer who would make a claim to redeem tokens.

the solidity code would finsih its transaction without issuinga  token but emit an event that beaconchain would pick up. beacon chainw ould make the web3 api request / or some NFT specific request and call a callback with its response!
then that tx can issue tokens for the end client to use for the merch drop.
the client can also use on chain encryption to share their PII to the nft project




alternatively, a query can be made off chain using javascript to get a signed assertion from bacon chain - beacon chain can be used as a signing service.

also it's possible that the developer is able to be their own oracle service and in web3 javascript create a signed assertion that is equivalent of the web3 api. 

the problem is that this would be a server -- so basically token host can do this and offer signed web3 api queries for end users! this could be verified on chain and only require one transaction.

i think that both are interesting


we are going to write a diamond facet that serves as a helper for making simple queries - maybe eth wallet balance is an ok one to start with :) 

we'll want to have time stamps in the callbacks as well and functions can decide how stale things can be
